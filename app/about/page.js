        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Like many great ideas, our ecommerce journey started small. We wanted
          to build a platform that truly focuses on customer satisfaction rather
          than just selling products. Over time, we expanded our catalog,
          improved our user interface, and introduced better features to make
          your shopping experience smoother.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Today, we are proud to serve a growing community of happy users who
          trust our platform for their everyday shopping needs.
